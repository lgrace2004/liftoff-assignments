Angular vs React vs Vue frameworks

Pre-class research: Vue easy for new developers (me!) to pick up. Single developer vs React, which is backed by FB. Vue and React pretty basic, compared with Angular.
Angular is more comprehensive. Lots to learn, more widely used than vue. Vue and React are easiest to deploy.

At meetup:  
Most developers setting up apps for small startups use React. Most stars on Github; most used in US. Angular rules in S America/Europe/Asia, Vue rules in N Africa.
React has lots of small libraries which will increase size. like react-router-dom.
Vue has least steep learning curve, Angular has steepest.

General observations: couple of people obviously asking questions/commenting b/c interested in getting a job here. Most people mute. Few people from company who are here and look terminally bored b/c they have just spent all day talking about this stuff. One really with it guy. They should grab him. One older guy who asks questions but doesn’t really get it. Then there is me with my initial disclaimer that I would only understand 30% of what is presented. Should modify that to 10%. 

Conference room smells like a cross between an indoor pool and a men’s locker room. Rough.

Questions:
Q1: If React is hard to learn and less intuitive than Angular (speaker's opinion, of course, since he started this Angular meetup), why is it so popular in US?
	A: Good for startups. (Q2, but really, how many startups can there be?) No good answer. Q3: Did React predate Angular? A: No, but predated Angularjs, which was not as great as Angular (once again, speaker opinion).

Where to go for future answers: wow, 100 people => 100 opinions.
