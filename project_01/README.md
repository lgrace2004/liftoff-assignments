# Capstone Project Plan
Amazing Grace Honey Website


## Overview
I would like to create an interactive website for my sons’ honey business. They currently sell honey door to door and take new orders via emails, texts, or phone calls. Problems with this luddite method: 
1. Inventory is not tracked.
2. No advertising. (2nd most significant need)
3. Clients have questions and desire to know about the process. (1st most significant need)
 
 The website would help organize the process.

There should be two user types: administrator and client.

## Features
Admin login.
Section explaining process, with photos.
Blog section.
Inventory tracking.
Request form for orders. (I still want boys to have personal experience with money transactions, so I don’t want to have clients be able to pay online.)

## Technologies
Javascript
HTML
CSS
Angular or React
SQL?

## What I'll Have to Learn
Angular or React
How to create and integrate back end with front end; don’t know how everything interweaves.
